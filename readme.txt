Shows images as thumbnails below a shortened post, that are within the hidden part.

== Description ==

This plugin shows images as thumbnails below the teaser-text of a post. Only images are shown, that are not contained within the teaser-text, so visitors can have a teaser of further images of the post along the teaser-text and may not overlook some beautiful photos that are not displayed in the teaser-text on the home page.

The plugin only contains one line of displayed text, but it's already translateable. If you want to use it in another language (that's not currently supported), feel free to contact me so I may extend the languagefiles.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip-file and upload the `show-other-images`-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =
* Bugfix: The header-text was shown even if there were no images in the rest of the post.

= 1.1 =
* Bugfix: If the original sized image was embedded in the teaser of a post, it would not get detected and it's thumb would have been shown below the post.

= 1.0 =
* Initial Release
